                PyCon SG is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.
            </p>
            <p>
                We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an
                enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
                courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially
                sponsored by PyCon or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers
                at any PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce
                this code throughout the event.

                    PyCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
                    gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
                    tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many
                    different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
                    including talks.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that
                    harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole
                    discretion of the conference organizers.

                <p class="mt-4 font-bold text-pyyellow">
                    Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
                </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Longer Version</h2>
            <p>
                Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
                stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the
                anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
                material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
                otherwise create a sexualized environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can
                be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may
                take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference
                with no refund.
            </p>
